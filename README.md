# Steps to run the code:

This implementation requires MATLAB 2018b or a more recent version.

# a) DMPC: This part is an implementation of discrete MPC with Laguere function for linear systems (vehicle lateral control in this case)

          1) Run the script 'Lainch_MPC.m'.
          2) The script loads trajectory data (Double lane change maneuver or other trajectories).
          3) The script loads the parameters for the vehicle model and MPC controller (Params.mat).
          4) Simulation starts with the chosen parameters. You can try different trajectories and change the MPC parameters to compare its performance.
          5) Note that it is important to adjust MPC constraints accordingly, or it will diverge.

# b) NN_MPC: This part is an implementation of discrete MPC with neural network-based adaptive parameters (Np, Nc, Q, R, etc.)

          1) You can run the script 'Launch_NNMPC' to start.
          2) The script loads the parameters for the vehicle model and MPC controller (Params.mat).
          3) Simulation starts with the chosen parameters. You can try different trajectories and change the MPC parameters to compare its performance.
          4) Note that it is important to have all files in the main folder or added to the Matlab path.

# c) ANFIS_MPC: This part is an implementation of discrete MPC with ANFIS-based adaptive parameters (Np, Nc, Q, R, etc.)

          1) You can run the script 'Launch_ANFISMPC' to start.
          2) The script loads the parameters for the vehicle model and MPC controller (Params.mat).
          3) Simulation starts with the chosen parameters. You can try different trajectories and change the MPC parameters to compare its performance.
          4) Note that it is important to have all files in the main folder or added to the Matlab path.
          5) Note that the code might run slowly depending on your machine (this version has not yet been optimized to run fast)

# d) PSO_MPC: This code optimizes the MPC parameters (Np, Nc, Q, R, etc.) with an enhanced PSO algorithm through iterative simulations

          1) Run the script 'PSO_MPC.m.
          2) The script sets up the optimization problem through the script "mpc_param.m", and executes the optimization through the script "PSO_test.m".
          3) The code simulates the vehicle model in "MPC.slx" to optimize the controller parameters by minimizing the cost function defined in "mpc_param" (please check the paper for more details)
          4) At the end of the optimization, the data of optimal parameters will be saved in an Excel file (check "mpc_param" to know which file)
